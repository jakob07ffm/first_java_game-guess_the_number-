# GuessTheNumber Game

## Overview

The **GuessTheNumber** program is a simple console-based game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game gives feedback on each guess, letting the player know if their guess was too high, too low, or correct. The game continues until the player guesses the correct number, and then it displays the number of attempts taken.
